# Verilog-5CSEMA5F31C6(Cyclone II)
**Lab2**- Implementing a 2 input multiplexer and a 7 segment hex decoder on the DE1-SoC board.
**Lab3**- Implementing a simple ALU using the case statement in verilog.
**Lab4**- Part1- Implementing a D Latch using logic gates
      Part2- Implementing a register for the ALU made in Lab3
      Part3- Making 8 bit shift right unit with the option to Arithmetic right shift
**Lab5**-Part1-Making a 4 bit counter using T flip flop using with a active low asynchronous reset and displaying on the HEX display of the DE1 board
     Part2-Implementing a rate divider to control the speed of the clock, thereby control speed of counting.
     Part3-Implementing a morse code decoder using the rate divider and a look up table.
**Lab6**-Implenting a simple FSM
    - Using the FSM, we also implement the operation of solving a quadratic equation by have a control and datapath unit which computes values at each stage of the calculations.
**Lab7**- Learning to make a RAM interface and writing values to it at different addresses. We use a HEX display to display the addresses being written to.
    - Using the VGA display to make a 4X4 square on the screen at a particular (x,y) coordinate and a particular colour which is fed into the VGA signal generator.
